# PERN Stack: One to Many - Front-end

## Important

Make sure all your routes work as expected. It does not matter how amazing your front-end code is; it cannot repair a broken back-end.

> **Note**: If needed, you can also clone down the completed back-end [here](https://github.com/jmoncayo-pursuit/express-one-to-many.git)

## Getting Started

- `git clone https://github.com/jmoncayo-pursuit/starter-pern-crud.git`

- `npm install`
- `touch .env`
